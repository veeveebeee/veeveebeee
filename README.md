### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by!

I'm currently studying to become a Software Engineer and looking to transition into a full-time tech role, having worked in the fitness industry (specialising in post-natal training). Focused and organised with a passion for problem solving, I'm looking forward to more learning and growth (and building more projects on here), and discovering the opportunities tech has to offer!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my Software Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve finished studying Python and am about to start some web dev.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... my transferable skills!
